"""
    This function initiates the SIFT detector, which relies on keypoints, descriptors
    and matcher to perform the algorithm. Each keypoint and descriptor pair up to find a point,
    and the matcher takes the matched pair to perform matching. When all the matchings are done,
    they are sorted from shortest distance (shorter being better matched.

    Input:
    userImg - Grayscale user logo
    DBImg - Grayscale database logo

    Output:
    matchedPairs - An array of all the matching descriptions, consist of distances.
    kp1, kp2 - Matched pair's element, kp1 and kp2 takes each side of the pair and becomes a set of it.

    My own implementation of cv2.drawMatches as OpenCV 2.4.9
    does not have this function available but it's supported in
    OpenCV 3.0.0

    This function takes in two images with their associated 
    keypoints, as well as a list of DMatch data structure (matches) 
    that contains which keypoints matched in which images.

    An image will be produced where a montage is shown with
    the first image followed by the second image beside it.

    Keypoints are delineated with circles, while lines are connected
    between matching keypoints.

    Input:
    img1,img2 - Grayscale images
    kp1,kp2 - Detected list of keypoints through any of the OpenCV keypoint 
              detection algorithms
    matches - A list of matches of corresponding keypoints through any
              OpenCV keypoint matching algorithm

    Output:
    out - An image of two compared images, placed side-by-side with top 10
          matches marked with a pair of points connected by a green line
